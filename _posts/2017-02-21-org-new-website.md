Our site [www.citygml.guru](https://www.citygml.guru) is starting from today the official site of CityGML (ie we get the ORG domain), and we're very happy about this!

We aim at offering help, documentation, tips, example datasets, and tutorials, and we will make sure that it is kept up-to-date.
We currently have, among others, the following: 

  - several [sample datasets]({{ site.url }}/samplefiles/) (included different examples of the different primitives)
  - [a list of a openly available cities in CityGML]({{ site.url }}/3dcities/), and those in other formats too
  - [a list of software that are CityGML v2.0 compatible]({{ site.url }}/software/)
  - [the complete schema of CityGML, *browsable*]({{ site.url }}/schemas/doc-complete/citygml)
  - [news]({{ site.url }}/news/) about all new developments of CityGML

Anyone who also loves CityGML is more than welcome to contribute to the site by submitting new content and/or fixing errors.
We are particularly looking for new software, and a more exhaustive list of [ongoing developments]({{ site.url }}/ongoingdev/).

The [source code is publicly available and hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/tudelft3d/website-citygml), and if you want to contribute please visit [this page]({{ site.url }}/contribute/).

Cheers,
