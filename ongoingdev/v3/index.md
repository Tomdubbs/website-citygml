# CityGML v3.0

New stuff that CityGML v3.0 is to contain:

  - A multi-representation framework
  - Storeys for indoor (now only rooms are supported)
  - Bringing CityGML more in line with INSPIRE
  - Semantic representation for land administration
  - Development of new facilities for specification and application of both textures and material properties
  - Dynamic objects
  - A representation for utility networks suitable for simulation and analysis
  - Alternate representations with a volumetric basis more in line with IFC
  - Versioning within a file, planning alternatives, multiple futures and multiple pasts
  - More extensive parameterisation of implicit geometries
