# CityGML v3.0

**Copied from an email on the OGC-CityGML mailing list, it's certainly useful for most involved to have it here.**

After having done a lot of fundamental work on CityGML ranging from the UML model to dynamizers and from other constructions to a new LoD model we, the chairs of the CityGML SWG, are now focusing on the journey towards planned publication of CityGML v3.0 in Spring 2019. We have taken the liberty to involve both Thomas and Tatjana in a planning towards finishing CityGML 3.0 as TUM is committed to sponsor the creation of the specifications with a very significant amount of effort and time.
 
## Output
 
We foresee two separate specification documents to be published:
  - CityGML Conceptual Model specification 3.0 (publication target January 2019)
  - CityGML GML encoding specification 3.0 (publication target March/April 2019)

    [The current ones are on GitHub](https://github.com/opengeospatial/CityGML-3.0)
 
Other encodings may be developed and published separately but are currently not part of a CityGML 3.0 release plan.
 
## Scope
 
There has been a varied amount of progress with each of the 14 Work Packages we set out to work on back in 2014. Based on the progress made to date we suggest to include the following items/work results in CityGML 3.0:
 
  - WP1 - Revise and maintain the UML representations of the conceptual model(s) – status: to be finalised by December 2017
  - WP2 - Design and implement the standards document(s) – status: Editors have first draft for table of content; content for specifications to be written during 2018
  - WP3 - Revise the level-of-detail (LoD) concept – status: completed
  - WP4 - Remove root-level inheritance from GML and separation of conceptual model and encodings – status: completed
  - WP6 - Develop a representation for changing content of entire models or parts of a model. This includes time-sequences of successive representations, simultaneously existing alternate versions, mobile objects, and dynamic objects – status: completed, implementation through versioning and dynamizers
  - WP9 - Develop a representation for non-building building-like structures – status: completed
  - WP11 - Develop a representation for volumetric construction and work toward harmonization with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) – status: volumetric constructions supported (IFC harmonization is worked on in IDBE outside of the CityGML SWG)
  - WP12 - Develop representation for metadata, complex attributes, and harmonize with INSPIRE – status: harmonisation with INSPIRE building theme completed (no results regarding metadata and complex attributes)
  - WP13 - Develop a representation for storeys (Am. “stories”) and other new semantic constructs – status: completed
 
Note on WP10 - Develop a representation for utility networks – status: in discussion with Utility ADE group; agreement that this will not be included in the CityGML specification before version 3.1.
 
Please let us know if you’d like to contribute to any part of CityGML 3.0 as an editor.
