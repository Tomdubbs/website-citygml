# How to contribute to this website?

While this website is made and maintained with <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i> by the [3D Geoinformation group at the TU Delft](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), anyone who also loves CityGML is more than welcome to contribute by submitting new content and/or fixing errors.

The website is a set of static pages, no DBMS or CMS is used. 
The [source code is publicly available and hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/tudelft3d/website-citygml).

[Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) is used to generate static pages from the source, and these are generated *automatically* after someone pushes to the repository (it may take ~30s to refresh though).

To add a news or a public datasets for instance, see the [README](https://github.com/tudelft3d/website-citygml/blob/master/README.md).

If you spotted an error or want to add content, let us know by either: 

  - [adding an issue](https://github.com/tudelft3d/website-citygml/issues);
  - fixing the error yourself and opening a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
